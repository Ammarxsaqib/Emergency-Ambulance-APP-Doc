2. Activity Diagram
2.1 Overview

 The Activity Diagram for the Emergency Ambulance
App delineates the workflow for users during emergency scenarios. The process
initiates with the user triggering an emergency request, prompting the app to
verify the user's location through GPS. After determining the location, the app
proceeds to communicate with nearby hospitals, displaying a list of available
options. A decision point is incorporated, enabling users to choose a specific
hospital for assistance. Following this decision, the app establishes real-time
communication with the selected hospital, facilitating direct interaction
between users and emergency services. The process concludes after providing
confirmation to the user, ensuring a clear visualization of the sequential

3. Sequence Diagram
3.1 Overview
â€¢	The sequence initiates with the user triggering the "Initiate Emergency Request" operation.
â€¢	The Emergency Request Processor processes the request and sends a synchronous message to the location tracker component to "Determine User Location".
â€¢	Upon receiving the "Determine User Location" message, the location tracker utilizes GPS to ascertain the user's current location.
â€¢	The determined location is then forwarded to the Hospital locator component.
â€¢	The Hospital Locator processes the user's location and sends a synchronous message to the Display Hospitals component to "Show Nearby Hospitals."
â€¢	After the user views the nearby hospitals, a decision point allows the user to select a specific hospital for assistance.
â€¢	The selected hospital information is then conveyed to the Emergency Services Communication component.
â€¢	Real-time communication is established with the selected hospital, allowing direct interaction between the user and emergency services.
â€¢	Following the communication, a synchronous message is sent to the user for confirmation.
â€¢	The user decides whether to proceed with the chosen hospital or cancel the request.
â€¢	The sequence concludes with a confirmation message or cancellation acknowledgment, providing a detailed technical overview of the emergency response system's dynamic interactions.
